## .waffle
A very inefficient file format (10 - 30x as much storage than .png)

Made by me.

### Usage
pngToWaffle(pngPath, resultName).                                            
The path and the name of the result.

waffleToPng(wafflePath, resultname)
Same as above

[It's also an NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/waffle-image-format)

Thanks.
